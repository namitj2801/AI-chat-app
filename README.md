# AI App Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

**AI App Next.js** is a web application that leverages AI-powered features using the Next.js framework. The project demonstrates how to build modern, scalable, and interactive web apps with server-side rendering, API routes, and component-based architecture.

### Main Functionalities

- **AI-Powered Interactions:** Integrates with AI models or APIs to provide intelligent responses or content generation (e.g., chat, code generation, or other AI tasks).
- **API Routes:** Custom API endpoints under `app/api/` for backend logic, such as handling AI requests or processing data.
- **Component-Based UI:** Reusable React components for a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Modern Styling:** Uses global styles and modern CSS for a clean, responsive interface.
- **File and Asset Management:** Includes SVGs and other assets in the `public/` directory for UI elements.

### How It Works

1. **User Interface:** Users interact with the app through a clean, responsive UI built with React components.
2. **AI Requests:** When a user submits a prompt or interacts with an AI feature, the frontend sends a request to the appropriate API route.
3. **Backend Processing:** The API route processes the request, communicates with the AI model or service, and returns the result.
4. **Display Results:** The frontend displays the AI-generated response or content to the user in real time.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Global styles are defined in `app/globals.css`. The root layout is managed in `app/layout.js`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font).
